Q-1)
In pig Programs, MAP-REDUCE programs work. It forms an interface for user to avoid the various complicacies in plain Map-Reduce Programming

Q-2)
-Simplifies Hadoop by allowing SQL-like queries to a distributed datatset.
- eat anything, means Pig can run on data with or withoiut metadata. In Pig , there is no Metadata.
- Pig survives in any environment: language for parallel data processing. It is not tied to any particular framework.
- Pig fly: process data super fast, no need to go through time consuming data import process prior to running process, as in conventional databases.
-Pig allow integration os user code where possible so it supports field transformation functions, user defined aggregrates, user defined conditionals.
-While Map-Reduce requires programmers to think in terms of map and reduce, and must be java programmers, Pig runs on Pig latin newly generated by Apache.
- Pig allows development times to be challenging.


Q-3) 
The component of Pig that accepts Pig Latin scripts as input and converts those scripts into MapReduce jobs.


Q-4)
Mode os pig execution are:
-local mode: All files are installed and run from local host and local file system. Generally used for testing. 
	Pig -x local
-MapReduce mode: here we need to load and process data that exists in HDFS. Here MapReduce job is involved in the back end for each Pig Latin statement.
	Pig -x mapreduce
	Pig

Q-5)
It is a shell where we execute Pig statements. In addition it provides certain useful shell, and utility commands.

Q-6)
Key properties are:
-Ease of programming: Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences making them easy to write, understand and maintain.
-optimisation opportunity: The way in which tasks are encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics ratehr than efficiency.
- extendability: User can create their own functions to do special purpose processing.

Q-7)
The names of relations and fields are case sensitive 
The names of Pig functions are case sensitive.
The names of parameters and all other Pig Latin keywords, are case insensitive.

Q-8)
After data is loaded, multiple operations(eg filters, groups, sorts, etc) are applied on that data before the final output is stored.
Pig provides developers many operations which can be applied ont the data one after another to get the final output. Once data is loaded, it flows through all the Pig Operations, in sequence.
This is Data flow language.
